         <p class="fw-bolder">Vision</p>
       </h4>

         <ol> <p> <strong> Problem/context: </strong> In this digital Era people's connections are becoming superficial and shallow </p>

         <P> <strong> Statement/belief: </strong> It is necessary to drift away from an excessive self-focus and open our minds and hearts to others </P>

         <P> <strong> Desired Outcome: </strong> Only then we can revive the sense of community and togetherness and build a world of real connections  </P>

         <P> “In a world where life gets busy, and connections become brief and shallow. We believe that only if we manage to look outside of ourselves to others. Only then we can build a caring world of real connections, where we can truly reveal ourselves backstage." </p> </ol>

        <h4>
          <p class="fw-bolder">Values</p> </h4>
          <ol> 
            <p>

          <li> <strong> Honesty: </strong> Our brand stands for authenticity and comfort, and we can only reach that outcome with honesty. By prioritizing honesty, we are motivating people to engage in deeper and more genuine connections. </li>

          <li> <strong> Open-mindedness: </strong> We aim to create a safe environment, where everyone feels welcome regardless of their background, age, gender etc It is important that we stablish the bases needed for people to feel seen, so that they can share their sincere opinion without being or feeling judged.  </li>

          <li> <strong> Care: </strong> We prioritise empathy and compassion for others. This value involves looking beyond ourselves to others and build meaningful connections, fostering a community where individuals can be authentic and reveal themselves and feel supported by sharing their opinions and thoughts for a common passion.  </li>

          <li> <strong> Support: </strong> We aim to create a platform where people can be themselves and talk to others about their connection with theatre. It is important to have a sense of support within this community where everyone can share their experiences without being judged.
        </li>

          <p class="fw-bolder">Persona</p> </h4>

          <ol>

         <p> <strong> Name: </strong> Evelyn  </p>

         <p> <strong> Age: </strong> 56 years old  </p>

         <p> <strong> Occupation:</strong> Librarian  </p>

        <p> <strong> Education:</strong> Bachelor's degree in English Literature  </p>        

        <p> <strong> Personality:</strong> Friendly, curious, sociable, cat-person  </p>

        <p> <strong> Marital Status:</strong> Married 
     </p>

   </ol>

   <ol>

    <p>

      <p> <strong> Bio:</strong> Evelyn works as a librarian for most of her career, fostering a love of literature and learning in her community. In her free time, she attends book club meetings and explores cultural events like theatre performances. Evelyn has noticed a decline in the quality of theatre productions in recent years, which has decreased her enthusiasm for attending shows. However, she remains hopeful that she will discover new and captivating performances to enjoy. She values her friendships and often attends cultural events with friends who share her interests. Despite her frustrations, Evelyn remains open-minded and continues to seek out new experiences and opportunities for intellectual stimulation. 
    </p>

     <p>  <strong> Social Media Usage:</strong> Evelyn uses Instagram to stay in touch with friends and family, share updates, and engage in literary discussions. While she appreciates its convenience, she prioritizes face-to-face interactions and finds excessive social media time draining.  </p> 

 
     <p> <strong> Motivations: </strong> Exploring cultural activities, staying connected with friends and family, lifelong learning. Now that her kids have grown and left home, Evelyn and her husband find themself with new free time that they would like to spend in cultural and enriching activities they enjoy. </p>

 
     <p> <strong> Goals:</strong> Engaging in leisure activities, attending cultural events, such as ballet, shows and concerts, but also expanding her knowledge. </p>

 

     <p> <strong> Frustrations: </strong> Feeling that theatre productions are becoming less appealing over time, challenges with crowded theatre, limited availability of high-quality performances </p>

   </p>
     
 </ol>

        <h4>
          <p class="fw-bolder">Brand Name</p> </h4>
            <ol>
          <p> <strong> Why The Backstage?: </strong> We chose “The Backstage” for our Brand’s name, because in theatres even if the show is on the stage there is a lot of hard work going on in the backstage that the audience does not get to experience. Therefore, we want to bring the backstage to the audience, where people can embrace our brand with an open mind and honesty, being left with the feeling that they are being cared for in a supportive environment. This way, we are able to expand the theatre experience, without secrets, just authenticity. </p> </ol>
