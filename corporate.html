         <ol> <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> Problem/context: </strong> In this digital Era people's connections are becoming superficial and shallow </p>

         <P class="texthomepage"> <strong> Statement/belief: </strong> It is necessary to drift away from an excessive self-focus and open our minds and hearts to others </P>

         <P class="texthomepage"> <strong> Desired Outcome: </strong> Only then we can revive the sense of community and togetherness and build a world of real connections  </P>

         <P class="texthomepage"> “In a world where life gets busy, and connections become brief and shallow. We believe that only if we manage to look outside of ourselves to others. Only then we can build a caring world of real connections, where we can truly reveal ourselves backstage." </p> </ol>

          <li class="texthomepage"> <strong> Care: </strong> We prioritise empathy and compassion for others. This value involves looking beyond ourselves to others and build meaningful connections, fostering a community where individuals can be authentic and reveal themselves and feel supported by sharing their opinions and thoughts for a common passion.  </li>

          <li class="texthomepage"> <strong> Support: </strong> We aim to create a platform where people can be themselves and talk to others about their connection with theatre.

    <p>

      <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> Bio:</strong> Evelyn works as a librarian for most of her career, fostering a love of literature and learning in her community. In her free time, she attends book club meetings and explores cultural events like theatre performances. Evelyn has noticed a decline in the quality of theatre productions in recent years, which has decreased her enthusiasm for attending shows. However, she remains hopeful that she will discover new and captivating performances to enjoy. She values her friendships and often attends cultural events with friends who share her interests. Despite her frustrations, Evelyn remains open-minded and continues to seek out new experiences and opportunities for intellectual stimulation. 
    </p>

     <p class="texthomepage">  <strong> Social Media Usage:</strong> Evelyn uses Instagram to stay in touch with friends and family, share updates, and engage in literary discussions. While she appreciates its convenience, she prioritizes face-to-face interactions and finds excessive social media time draining.  </p> 

 
     <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> Motivations: </strong> Exploring cultural activities, staying connected with friends and family, lifelong learning. Now that her kids have grown and left home, Evelyn and her husband find themself with new free time that they would like to spend in cultural and enriching activities they enjoy. </p>

 
     <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> Goals:</strong> Engaging in leisure activities, attending cultural events, such as ballet, shows and concerts, but also expanding her knowledge. </p>

 

     <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> Frustrations: </strong> Feeling that theatre productions are becoming less appealing over time, challenges with crowded theatre, limited availability of high-quality performances </p>

        <h4>
          <p class="fw-bolder texthomepage">Brand Name</p> </h4>
            <ol>
          <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> Why The Backstage?: </strong> We chose “The Backstage” for our Brand’s name, because in theatres even if the show is on the stage there is a lot of hard work going on in the backstage that the audience does not get to experience. Therefore, we want to bring the backstage to the audience, where people can embrace our brand with an open mind and honesty, being left with the feeling that they are being cared for in a supportive environment. This way, we are able to expand the theatre experience, without secrets, just authenticity. </p> </ol>
          
          <h4>
            <p class="fw-bolder">Visual Identity</p> </h4>
              <ol>
                <p class="texthomepage">We understand our persona's frustrations with the declining quality of theatre productions and the challenges of crowded venues. That's why our visual identity is designed to create a welcoming and immersive atmosphere, encouraging her and other theatre lovers to rediscover the joy of attending cultural events. Through our brand's commitment to authenticity and refinement, we aim to provide them with memorable experiences that align with their motivations for exploration and lifelong learning. </p>

            <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> The colours: </strong>Our visual identity, characterized by the calming tons of blue, purple, and the vibrant energy of green, is carefully made to align with our brand values and vision. Blue conveys a sense of trust and honesty, aligning perfectly with our commitment to integrity and sincerity. Purple symbolizes openness and creativity, reflecting our value of open-mindedness and our belief in the power of diverse perspectives within the theatrical community. Green represents growth, renewal, and care, embodying our dedication to raise connections and supporting one another in a world where authentic relationships are increasingly rare.</p> 
            <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> The fonts: </strong>Furthermore, the chosen fonts—The Seasons, Bely Display, Bennet Banner and DM Sans Light 300—enhance the sophistication and elegance of our brand, reinforcing the idea of revealing oneself "backstage" in a context that is both authentic and refined. Since our target audience is also older people, we decided to use understandable (easy to read) fonts, that are also big and well visible. By combining these elements, our visual identity creates a cohesive and immersive experience for our target audience of theatre lovers. It invites them to not only engage with the performances on stage but also to connect with each other and with themselves on a deeper level, in line with our brand vision of fostering a caring world of genuine connections. In essence, our visual identity serves as a visual manifestation of our brand values and vision, providing a compelling and resonant platform for meaningful engagement within the theatrical community.</p></ol>

              <p>
            <strong>Testing 1:</strong>Nuno 53 years old. The testing was in person at home, we used the computer as a device for the testing, we asked for the participant to go through the website and asked him questions according to our goals and what were his thoughts/comments/recommendations so we could match both the testing results and goals, but also look for possible improvemnts. 
            </p>

            <p>
            <li><strong>Usability:</strong> The tester navigates the website quite dynamically and intuitively. Despite this, he faces some trouble finding where exactly to leave his review. He says that maybe (and considering it is one of our main features), the option to ‘leave reviews’ shouldn’t be hidden under several pages. He would like to find the option clearer right since the beginning, especially because there are many buttons and not all of them are functional, which can be a bit misleading when trying to get to a desired destination. </li>
            <li><strong>User Experience (UX):</strong> The tester has no problems identifying the features (profile logo, chats logo, distinctive buttons etc). He indicates his satisfaction with the layout, he likes our logo, fonts and colours. He mentions three possible improvements in the navigation bar: having discovery and programmes visible (instead of inside a dropdown feature); explicitly indicating where to access the reviews (naming the discovery page ‘reviews’ for example); and having the different sections (‘behind the scenes’, ‘VIP’ etc) change colours as the arrow passes above them. </li>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong>The tester tried the website on the computer, and it performed as it should on this device.  </li>
            <li><strong>Functionality: </strong> The website operated successfully without any bugs. The tester wondered why the first time he clicked on the profile there was a ‘log in’ page; while the second time he clicked on it there was a pre-stablished profile. This profile should appear as you click the ‘log in’ button. Furthermore, when leaving an interview, the ‘submit’ button takes him to the ‘log in’ page. This is not a mistake but a marketing strategy. </li>
            <li><strong>Brand Consistency and Perception:</strong>  The website design aligns with the brand vision and values. The colours and fonts used in the visual identity are constantly used. There are many sections and CSS classes created for each. The Backstage website plays with the visual optionality chosen in a web that the website looks good and is also diverse. All the variations contribute to make the website entertaining and to catch the tester attention. The tester identifies easily the purpose of the brand and its intentions with this website. It seems cohesive to him how The Backstage attempts to create a community built upon sharing opinions and common passion, along with the website accessibility for this target audience.</li>
            <li><strong> Brand Messaging: </strong>Nuno as a member of our target audience (theatre lovers between 50 and 65), said he really enjoyed how easy it is to use the website, he does not like complexity when it comes to internet. He also appreciates the chats and profile feature, he thinks its a nice that he has the opportunity to meet new people, and see their interests because then you can connect with people that have the same tastes as you, and share even more "exclusive" opinions/sugetions. </li>

           <p><strong>Testing 2:</strong>Blanca 57 years old. The testing was in person at home, this time we used the mobile phone as a device for the testing, we asked for the participant to go through the website and asked her questions according to our goals and what were her thoughts/comments/recommendations so we could match both the testing results and goals, but also look for possible improvemnts. 
           </p>

            <p>
            <li><strong>Usability:</strong> The tester navigates the website without problems. She communicates that is simple and enjoyable to use. On a side note, she mentions that she would like the review option to be more present throughout the whole website. She understands it is one of our main features and she thinks she should not have to go back to the previous page to review a play when she is reading its reviews in the ‘all revies’ page. This is why she believes there should be an option to leave reviews here. Same as there should be more options to leave reviews in the discovery page and in your own profile (in the section of ‘my reviews’ for example). In the discovery page she would also like to be able to see how many reviews does each play have. Despite the feedback given she accomplishes the tasks quickly and is satisfied with the results. </li>
            <li><strong>User Experience (UX):</strong> The tester has no problems identifying the features (profile logo, chats logo, distinctive buttons etc). She often indicates how much she likes its looks. The colours are very appealing to her, and she mentions how they catch her attention. When it comes to the buttons, she makes a similar comment regarding how they stand out on each page. She says that she would like to have an extra button to ‘leave reviews’ in the ‘all reviews’ page; so as beneath ‘my reviews’. She would also like to find a way to contact the team visible on the website.  </li>

            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> The tester tried the website on her phone, every page performed as it should on this device.   </li>
            <li><strong>Functionality: </strong> The website operated successfully without any bugs or errors. All the links worked properly. At some point the tester thought a button was not working; but it was a non-functional button. Other than that, there wasn’t any other inconvenience.  </li>
            <li><strong>Brand Consistency and Perception:</strong> The website design aligns with the brand vision and values. The colours and fonts used in the visual identity are constantly used. There are many sections and CSS classes created for each. The Backstage website plays with the visual optionality chosen in a web that the website looks good and is also diverse. All the variations contribute to make the website entertaining and to catch the tester attention. The tester really likes the brand based on her interaction of the website. As an adult woman and theatre lover herself, she assures that she wouldn’t hesitate on creating her own profile. She believes the website would be very useful for her and solve the problems she faces trying to find a community that shares her passion. She is also excited to know about other people opinions and take in their recommendations (so as eager to share hers).  </li>

            <p><strong>Testing 3:</strong>Ana 50 years old. The testing was in person at home, this time we used a tablet as a device for the testing, we asked for the participant to go through the website and asked her questions according to our goals and what were her thoughts/comments/recommendations so we could match both the testing results and goals, but also look for possible improvemnts.

            <p>
            <li><strong>Usability:</strong> The tester navigates the website without problems. She highlights that she likes the color palette, attention catching images and clear text. She confesses being a bit confused where in Europe, we are sellling tickets for. At first she failed to understand that the website is not only for seeing what programmes are on and couldn't find where the reviews where but after a bit of more exploring and getting used to the website's dynamic she found the place to submit her review.</li>
            <li><strong>User Experience (UX):</strong> The tester has no problems identifying the features expect the VIP dropdown menu, she didn't understand at first what it was for. She tought that the links between the website are smooth and the navigation in the website is very intuitive and simple. She found some stuggle to understand why she could access other chats in the chats page but then we explain that it was non-functional chat.<li>

          <p><strong>Testing 5:</strong>Conceicao 53 years old. The testing was in person at home, we used a mobile phone as a device for the testing, we asked for the participant to go through the website and asked her questions according to our goals and what were her thoughts/comments/recommendations so we could match both the testing results and goals, but also look for possible improvemnts. 
           </p>

            <p>
            <li><strong>Usability:</strong> The tester navigates the website quite dynamically and intuitively. The tester likes that the icons are simple (she uses the word standard) and easy to recognize along with some of the pages (profile logo, chats logo and login page). She mentions that everything looks very aesthetic pleasing and accessible to her, which is something she always looks when going on websites. She understands what the are the goals/purposes we want to provide within our website (The pages are very straight forward she says). </li>
            <li><strong>User Experience (UX):</strong>  The tester does not really understand the utility of the VIP on the navigation bar, she suggests that it would be clear if we just took down the VIP and put both the programmes and discovery apart in the navigation bar (along with newsletter, behind the curtain, etc). In the discovery page she thinks it would be better to have first the shows that are on stage and then below put the upcoming plays. She would also like to have along with the shows descriptions some information about the cast and people involved in the show production (she says that she takes that very much into account when going to the theatre). She enjoys the Behind the curtain page because it makes her feel connected to the website creators and the brand itself. </li>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong>  The tester tried the website on the mobile phone, and it performed as it should on this device.  </li>
            <li><strong>Functionality: </strong> The website operated successfully without any bugs. The tester wondered wondered why some buttons did not work (we explained that the website does not have to be fully functional) or for example why when clicking on submitting reviews it would lead her to the login page (we mention that it was our way to make people join our website by creating an account) This is not a mistake but a marketing strategy. </li>
            <li><strong>Brand Consistency and Perception:</strong> The website design aligns with the brand vision and values. The colours and fonts used in the visual identity are constantly used. The Backstage website plays with the visual optionality chosen in a web that the website looks good and is also diverse. The tester likes the combination of the colours and mentions that the use of different colours (purple, green, blue) was a nice way to leave behind the typical traditional and classic colours (red, black, orange) that most of theatre websites use. It makes our website stand out and it gives her the perception that we live in a “current realistic modern world”. She thinks the fonts match very well with the aesthetic and likes the fact they are big, since it makes it easier to read. Conceicao ends up by concluding and confirming that she gets our brand and website, she says it seems a nice service to promote culture and artistic interests between people that have the same passions.  </li>
            <li><strong> Brand Messaging: </strong>:Conceicao is part of our target audience (theatre lovers between 50-65 years old) she is a producer designer that loves to go to the theatre with her friends in her free time and explore what’s out there for her. She says that for her age it is great that we kept in mind easy features and big and understandable fonts. She loves the fact that even if it is designed for older people, we gave it a modern and younger touch with our colour palette. </li>

          <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>This marketing campaign has the purpose to raise awareness and establish solid relationships within a brand and its potential users. The brand in question is our ‘The Backstage’, where we aim to be put out our product (website) in the market by Friday 5th of April. We tried to engage our target audience by sharing interesting content both on mail and social media. It was important for us that our content portrays the values and intentions of the project. In order to accomplish the goal, we previously had to come across a crystal-clear definition of our value proposition. We defined The Backstage as ‘a brand that intends to connect theatre lovers in an honest way; through care and support, it aims to create a safe and modern space in which users can express themselves and learn from each other open-mindedly'. A message that includes our four essential values: care, support, honesty and open mindedness.</p>
          <p>The promotional activities we executed were taken to term on two media channels. We used e-mail and Instagram to make our brand (and its consequent message) come across. Despite having both fronts open, we took the decision of dedicating extra effort and time in the latest channel (Instagram) since this was our main mean of communication. We chose Instagram because it is a simple and dynamic platform, very useful to spread our word. Anyone can see what is published in a public profile on this social media, which means your content can pop up in anyone's for your page. Therefore, it seems easier dragging new people and reaching a greater number of viewers. Furthermore, Instagram is vastly known and very popular, so it just made sense to use it. But also, Instagram is very visual and fast, creating brief impressions on people which are crucial to build our brand awareness</p>  
          <p>Types of posts we made:  
              <li>Event announcements (website launch, newsletter launch) - With these posts we wanted to keep the audience informed of what we just dropped or what we had yet to come. Brand objective of raising awareness about ‘The Backstage’</li> 
              <li>Brand Insights - the purpose of this posts is for the audience to feel closer to our brand. They get to know what we are all about. We stablish strong relationships with them by sharing our intentions.</li>   
              <li>Behind the scenes – these types of posts show transparency and authenticity we do not want our audience that we are hiding anything from them</li>
              <li>Promotional video – raise awareness and reach more people (meet our other objective of gaining followers). Make them feel attached to the company and start building a relationship</li>
              <li>Survey/polls, questions - with these posts we intended to make our profile dynamic and interactive.</li> 
              <li>Memes, fun facts, industry news - aimed to catch people’s attention, make them have fun and be invested in our page.</li>
              <li>Good morning and good night posts, thank you posts, greetings- to keep the audience engaged and transmit the values of caring and support that our brand stands for</li> 
              On top of that, we also used Chimp mail to create and distribute our newsletter. We decided to publish a new article on our newsletter every Sunday and keep our audience informed about it with our Instagram posts (we added the link to the newsletter in our Instagram bio too). 
              We decided to create a newsletter to make our audience feel closer to us, curious, attached and consequently become loyal supporters of our brand. All in all, the intention of the newsletter was to create a subscriber base and stablish strong long-term relationships with them. </p>


          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Target Audience</h4>
          <p>The audience chosen was adults within 50 and 65 years old. As we did our first interviews and dived deep into the Theatre Lovers we wanted to target. We decided on this age group due to the Google forms we created because most results were between the ages 45 to 54. However, in the in-person interviews, we found older people (between 55 and 77) who were interested in the theatre. With that said we decided to make our target group around the age gap (50 to 65), so it would be extremely broad. The generation targeted is more present on Facebook. However, several business and brand profiles are being put down and banned on Facebook, so our main social media platform during the campaign will be Instagram, due to being equally valid option for meeting our purpose.</p>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Effect</h4>
          <p>We want our target audience to feel a sense of community, where than can easily connect with other and freely share their passions and opinions about theatre and well-informed. We aim to guarantee that the before and after theatre experience is more enjoyable and easier. Moreover, we want to build trust, meaning in the target audience’s eyes we are a trustworthy brand.  </p>

            <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Response</h4>
          <p>In response we expect our target audience to engage with the website, once it is launched by leaving reviews, comments, starting conversations with each other, buying tickets and naturally mouth-to-mouth marketing </p>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Planning</h4>
          <h6 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">See Content Calendar in the Marketing Appendix</h6>


          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>Reflecting on the Communication & Media Plan executed for 'The Backstage' marketing campaign, several key learning points were recognised by the team from the challenges faced during the project. 

          <p>One significant issue that surfaced was the lack of commitment from certain team members, leading to difficulties not only in the workflow, following the content calendar, but also lack of good communication within the team. This lack of consistency slowed down our progress and kept us from working on perfecting this project. We tried to solve it with discussions and by setting inner deadlines but most of the time it was unsuccessful, we think that perhaps, in the beginning, we should’ve defined roles internally so the team itself could be more organized and know exactly what their responsibilities were.</p>

          <p>Another key learning point we encountered was the difficulty we had to find our target audience, as international students we do not have a lot of contact with adults in the ages of our target group in the Netherlands. We tried to interview people in the theatre in Breda and around town but did not get the best of outcomes, most people would tell us they were not simply keen on theatre. We were advised to go to different cities, but during the first weeks of this project we did not manage to organize such option and we also tried to avoid having extra costs. Nonetheless, it would have been certainly helpful and make our progress to find more people easier.</p>

          <p>Additionally, while our campaign objectives were ambitious, they may have been somewhat unrealistic given the timeframe and resources available. Specifically, we fell short on our targets for <strong> Instagram followers (which according to our objectives were 150, but we end up with a total of 77) and number of reaches (we expected 500 reaches, however we end up with 221). </strong> This shortfall highlights the need for more realistic goal setting and detailed understanding of the campaign's potential impact. Another aspect worth noting is the decision to focus solely on Instagram. We firstly wanted to also use a Facebook page, but we discover the platform has been banning business pages, so instead of trying to find a solution we sticked to only one channel. However, we are sure that diversifying our platform usage could have expanded our audience reach and engagement opportunities. We could have been more dynamic in our posts, try to invest more on videos and reels (since those showed up to be one of our user's favourites formats of content).  We should have also search for more feedback from our users by doing surveys, polls or Q&A's, which would have been helpful to understand not only what we were doing well but where we were failing at.</p>

          <p> Additionally, we published 4 newsletters every Sunday during our campaign, we were disappointed to notice that not only <strong>we did not achieve our 20 subscribers' goal (which was 10), as well as, only having 40% of them opening and engaging with our newsletters</strong>. We should examine the content, format, and timing of our newsletters to identify areas for improvement. Moreover, we should also improve our newsletters’ advertising, during the campaign we posted about our newsletter twice a week. However, we believe that perhaps sharing it in WhatsApp groups within our target audience and even do offline marketing such as making QR code flyers and spread it around the cities or around theatres in the Netherlands would have helped in a better outcome.  </p>

         <p>  Overall, we notice that along the campaign there was a decrease of interactions and audience engagement and that somehow, discouraged our team, which we now understand that it should have had the opposite effect and make us work harder and get more invested. However, in our opinion in the beginning we reached a lot of people and were invested, through mouth-of-mouth marketing we spoke to our family and friends and shared with them a google forms created by us that end up having around 115 answers, which we thought it was a good number. For that reason, we conclude that even if the campaign faced challenges and did not fully meet its objectives, it offered us valuable lessons for future campaigns, including the importance of team commitment and investment, realistic goal setting, platform diversification, audience engagement, and continuous evaluation and adaptation.</p>
         </p>
          
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>

          <p>In the coming year, we should focus on diversifying our content strategy even further. Since, our current mix of content has not been as engaging as we wanted, having a noticeable decrease in reaches and interactions, in the last weeks of campaign, we wonder if exploring additional ways of entertainment could deepen audience engagement.</p>  

          <p>For instance, incorporating user-generated content such as Instagram lives and partnerships with performers and influencers could empower our community to share their theater experiences as well, fostering a sense of inclusivity and participation. Additionally, interactive quizzes or games related to theater trivia as it was executed in our campaign. However, with more frequency and only through Instagram stories or reels format (since according to Instagram insights this type of content format showed up to be the most popular and liked between our followers) which will introduce the element of fun and encourage more audience interaction (just as how we wanted to have happen in this previous month).</p>

          <p>
            Moreover, enhancing personalization will be crucial in strengthening our connection with the audience. By segmenting our audience, this means target our audience within the Netherlands, if we narrow it down to a location, we have more time to explore the Dutch events and shows instead of creating content that is very broad and not reachable, for example if we post theatre news about Spain it will not be very realistic to have our Dutch audience engaged in that content as much as if it was about theatre in the Netherlands. 
          </p>

          <p>
          While Instagram has been our primary platform, we will try to go over Facebook (that is now banning business pages) and understand how we could implement our content in there (since it is one of the most used platforms within our target audience). As social media consumers ourselves, we spoke as a team and realised how the number of adults on Tik Tok has been increasing. We are now sure that for a future we should not just focus in one social media but expand and diversifying our media strategy, because every platform offers unique opportunities for content distribution and community building which will be a must to broaden our reach and engage new audience segments. Furthermore, establishing partnerships and trends such as “account takeover” (where the influencer posts the whole day and engages with people through Lives, Surveys, and Q&A’s) with influencers or micro-influencers in the theater niche can amplify our brand's reach and credibility.  </p>

          <p>For the upcoming year we will pay more attention and keep track/analyse the performance of our campaign elements such as looking through Instagram insights weekly. This way we can gain valuable insights into audience behaviour and content effectiveness.</p>

          <p> Maintaining open communication channels with our audience will be essential for gathering feedback and insights as well. Regular surveys, polls, or Q&A sessions can help us understand audience preferences, allowing us to improve our content strategy.</p>

          <p> Additionally, we would like to host offline events (for example at universities, theatres, and cafes) to reach new audiences. Creating a realistic marketing budget towards targeted ads on social media platforms which might amplify our brand's visibility.</p>

          <p> In summary, by implementing these recommendations and reinforce a bigger commitment to innovation and audience engagement, we can bring 'The Backstage' forward and be seen as a truly trusted and vibrant community for theater enthusiasts.</p>

            </ul>
            </li>
          </p>

            <p>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong> Existing alternatives: </strong> </li> Theatres in the Netherlands offer live streams or recordings of their performances for audiences unable to attend in person. Some theatres also expand the run of an event to accommodate more audience members.  </li> 
            </ul>
          </p>

            <p> 

            <li><strong> Struggle to find tickets: </strong>Nowadays people do not have the patience to look through multiple websites to find the right tickets.  </li> </p>

              <p>
                <ul>
             <li> <strong> Existing alternatives: </strong> Platforms like Ticket swap provide users to search available tickets for different events in one place. </li>

            <p>
              <ul>
            <li> <strong> Existing alternatives: </strong> Some theatres in the Netherlands offer discounted ticket programs for students, seniors, or members of specific organizations. Along with, theatres that may offer rush tickets or last-minute deals for unsold seats shortly before a performance. </li>
           </ul>
         </p>

           </p>
          </ol>

          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <p>

            <li>Modernizing Theatre Ticketing: Simplify Ticket Purchases, Discover Exciting Productions, and Engage with a Community of Theatre Enthusiasts. Experience easier Access to Your Favourite Shows, Making Every Theatre Visit an Unforgettable Journey. </li>
            <li>Our platform stands out because we've simplified the theatre ticketing process, making it easy to purchase tickets for favourite shows. Additionally, we offer a vibrant community where people can connect with other theatre enthusiasts, discover new productions, and access the best seats without any hassle. With us, your theatre experience is not just about watching a show—it's about connecting with a community and making memories that last a lifetime. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <p>

            <li>A fresh perspective, in our group we are between 20 and 21 so it allows us to bring a fresh perspective to the market, unaffected by industry conventions or legacy systems, which resonates with consumers seeking alternative options. </li>
            <li>Intellectual property, leveraging patented technology, unique designs, or proprietary algorithms gives us a distinct advantage, as these innovations are protected from replication by competitors. </li>
          </p>


          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <p>
            <li><strong>Instagram:</strong> Gen Z is drawn to aesthetically pleasing content, making Instagram's platform ideal for posting stunning photos and behind-the-scenes glimpses of stage productions. Gen Z values interaction and engagement with brands. Instagram's interactive features like polls and question stickers provide opportunities for direct engagement, allowing the brand to gather feedback and insights from Gen Z theater enthusiasts. We will also take advantage of theater-related hashtags on Instagram, that will give our brand a tap into Gen Z's interest in current trends and increase visibility.</li>
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <p>

            <li> Before having any social media we used customer acquisition rate as one of our key metrics. We manage to reach about 15 people through word-of-mouth and direct interactions with our family and friends.  </li>
            <li> Another initial key metric used by our team was the customer feedback score: We asked feedback from family and friends. We told them about our idea and value proposition and they gave us valuable insights such as if our value proposition actually resonated with the target audience we wanted to reach. It also helped us identify areas of strength and improvement according to our future website. </li>
      </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To help our brand in the beginning each one of the founders will invest around 100€ per 6 months (approximately 800€ in total investment)  </li>
            <li>Create a Free-Trial Model, which offers a free basic version of your product or service with limited features, while charging for premium upgrades, additional features, or enhanced functionality, appealing to both free users and paying customers. Since we have a new website that is not very well known the premium version would be 36€ per year (3€ monthly subscription). Aiming to achieve around at least 100 subscriptions, that would have a total of 360€ of revenue</li>
            <li> So, the overall revenue streams in the first year of developing our website would be 1160€</li> 
          </ul>

        </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>

            <li>For website development of our brand our team decided to not do an outside hire to execute this task so we could save on costs. Our team (the 4 founders of this brand) are the ones responsible for the development of the website. As well as content creation for the website, we would also be responsible for the writing, designs and photos on our website. Therefore, website developers and content creation hires will not be part of the fixed costs.  </li> 

          <br>
          <p>Fixed Costs

            <li>For the domain registration for “TheBackstage.site” we are going to subscribe to an annual subscription in “Domain.com” (see appendix) of 1,85€ and we also decided to include in the subscription a domain privacy and protection fee of 8,36€ (also per year). This leaves us with a total of a fixed annual cost for the website domain of 10,21€.</li>
            <li> We need to have a hosting server for our website, according to Forbes, a small simple subscription plan is the best for small/new websites. Therefore we will be taking the basic subscription plan with WordPress and Bluehost which is 1,85€ per month due to a current 75% discount they have. This would costs us 22,20€ for the first year. This plan also offers SSL Certificate which keeps personal information, e-commerce transactions and other sensitive data safeguarded with encrypted connections. </li>
          </p>

    			<p> Variable Costs
    				<li> We have to pay for the marketing of our website on social media platforms: We are using Instagram for our marketing and when advertising your brand on Instagram you can choose your own budget which you can change whenever you want. As we are just starting up, we will set our advertising budget to €10 a month to start with which will be an estimate of €120 in the first year. As we are able to change the price of our advertising budget to get more out of our advertising by paying a higher price or lowering our advertising this is a variable cost. </li> 
          </p>
          <br>
          <li> So, the overall costs in the first year of developing our website will be €152,41</li> 
        </ol>
      </ul>
    </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <p>
          <ul>

                <li> Social Media Groups: Facebook groups and Twitter accounts like @TheaterNL offer platforms for Dutch theater enthusiasts to share opinions. Many Dutch cities also have local theater communities and forums where enthusiasts can engage in discussions about performances happening in their area.</li>

          </p>
        

          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <p>
            <li> We created a google forms and send it to our family and friends (who also spread it around); We got 115 answers, where 52,2% of the people who answered where between the ages of 45 to 54, 53% identify as female and 84% live outside of the the Netherlands.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks our Instagram account reached 175 accounts these number includes accounts that have seen our content at least once, including in ads. 50 from these number was actual from our followers (which currently are 70) and 125 are non-followers.</li>

            <li> When it comes to likes and views. Our instagram videos have between 50 to 100 views and overall our posts have between 4 to 10 likes.</li>
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To help our brand in the beginning each one of the founders will invest around 100€ per 6 months (approximately 800€ in total investment)</li>
            <li> Our team will collaborate with theater-related student organizations on campus and from other colleges in the Netherlands to possible co-host events. Potentially attracting funding from student activity budgets or sponsorship from campus organizations. We expect them to cover over 1000€</li>
            <li>We also intent do get sponsorchips from theatre organizations, B2B situation where they invest in our brand and we will advertise them in our website and our links to buy tickets will take people to their website for ticket purchasing, we want to ask for at leat 7000€ for the first full year.</li>
            <li> Our team will also launch a crowdfunding campaign and share it on our platforms (Facebook and Instagram) to raise funds for your project we execpet to raise around a 500€.</li>
            <li>So in total for the first year of revenues streams we are aiming for 8300€</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
            <li>For website development of our brand our team decided to not do an outside hire to execute this task so we could save on costs. Our team (the 4 founders of this brand) are the ones responsible for the development of the website. As well as content creation for the website, we would also be responsible for the writing, designs and photos on our website. Therefore, website developers and content creation hires will not be part of the fixed costs.</li>
          <br>
          <p>Fixed Costs
            <li>For the domain registration for “TheBackstage.site” we are going to subscribe to an annual subscription in “Domain.com” (see appendix) of 1,85€ and we also decided to include in the subscription a domain privacy and protection fee of 8,36€ (also per year). This leaves us with a total of a fixed annual cost for the website domain of 10,21€.</li>
            <li> We need to have a hosting server for our website, according to Forbes, a small simple subscription plan is the best for small/new websites. Therefore we will be taking the basic subscription plan with WordPress and Bluehost which is 1,85€ per month due to a current 75% discount they have. This would costs us 22,20€ for the first year. This plan also offers SSL Certificate which keeps personal information, e-commerce transactions and other sensitive data safeguarded with encrypted connections.</li> 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Variable Costs</p>
          <li>We have to pay for the marketing of our website on social media platforms: We are using Instagram and Facebook. For our marketing and when advertising your brand on Instagram you can choose your own budget which you can change whenever you want. As we are just starting up, we will set our advertising budget to €500 a month to start with which will be an estimate of 6000€ in the first year. And for Facebook we dicided to pay for advertisment per mile as they call it, meaning 1000 impressions for 9,10€, so we decided to pay for this type of advertisement every week (52 weeks) leaving us with a total cost for facebook adds of approximately 473€. As we are able to change the price of our advertising budget to get more out of our advertising by paying a higher price or lowering our advertising. The total of social media marketing cost is 6473€</li>  
          <br>
          <li>So, the overall costs in the first year of developing our website will be of approximately 6506€</li> 
        </li>

          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The product marketed by The Backstage is a website in which theatre lovers can share reviews of plays they have watched of read, and where they can also find out about upcoming plays in The Netherlands. The website aims to create a sense of community in an industry that is often overlooked and forgotten. We believe that that there are a lot of people out there with a passion for theatre whose interests are not being well considered. And these people would love to connect and learn from each other. With ‘The Backstage’ they would be able to share their opinions with honesty, knowing they will find a safe and open-minded web on the other side. By people feeling taken care of and supported, we will make their theatre experience more enjoyable. We want to focus on a target group of older people (50 to 65) that maybe have enjoyed theatre their whole lives but as years went by lost connections within the industry. People that would like to reach for others with interests alike to theirs but do not really know how to do so. The Backstage will be an easy-to-use website that also aims to modernize theatre. This is why we are opting for a fresh look in the visual identity of the website. An aesthetic that portrays that passion for theatre can be modern and on-trend. That way, other generations can also feel a part of the digital world, as they discover how they can enjoy their passions online.</li>

            <li><strong>Instagram:</strong>The target audience aimed to be reached is between 50 and 65. We use Instagram to approach them, since most of the people among these ages use this platform instead of others like TikTok. We tried to create a page for our brand in Facebook since it is also one of the most famous social medias between our target audience, however it is difficult right now to create a page on the social media because they are getting banned. Instead, we made the decision to create an account on Instagram. In this platform we post daily photos and videos. And stories with fun facts or surveys. We started creating reels and posting memes since this is what seems to get more viral in the app. We have also started to use hashtags to try and reach a broader audience. We keep our profile updated and we are careful that it matches our visual identity. We use bright colours (green and purple) that intend to give the theatre a fresh and modern look.  </li>
            <li><strong>MailChimp</strong> We use MailChimp to distribute our newsletter. Every Sunday we share a new entrance. To the people subscribed to it we send them an email. We also added the link to it on our Instagram profile. We usually post a couple of post a week as a reminder and when we upload the new entrance we inform about it on Instagram. MailChimp enable us to create a good newsletter, the design in aesthetically pleasing and resonates with the visual identity we chose for The Backstage.

        </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>

          <li>For website development of our brand our team decided to not do an outside hire to execute this task so we could save on costs. Our team (the 4 founders of this brand) are the ones responsible for the development of the website. As well as content creation for the website, we would also be responsible for the writing, designs and photos on our website. Therefore, website developers and content creation hires will not be part of the fixed costs.  </li>
          <br>
          <p>Fixed Costs:
            <li>For the domain registration for “TheBackstage.site” we are going to subscribe to an annual subscription in “Domain.com” (see appendix) of 1,85€ and we also decided to include in the subscription a domain privacy and protection fee of 8,36€ (also per year). This leaves us with a total of a fixed annual cost for the website domain of 10,21€.</li>
            <li> We need to have a hosting server for our website, according to Forbes, a small simple subscription plan is the best for small/new websites. Therefore we will be taking the basic subscription plan with WordPress and Bluehost which is 1,85€ per month due to a current 75% discount they have. This would costs us 22,20€ for the first year. This plan also offers SSL Certificate which keeps personal information, e-commerce transactions and other sensitive data safeguarded with encrypted connections. </li> 
            <li>We are going to use Email Marketing to send out weekly newsletters through an email marketing company: "Mailchimp" which costs us €18,61 a month. This will be €223,32 the first year.</li>
            <li>We have to pay for the marketing of our website on social media platforms: We are using Instagram for our marketing and when advertising your brand on Instagram you can choose your own budget which you can change whenever you want. As we are just starting up, we will set our advertising budget to €60 a month to start with which will be an estimate of €700 in the first year. As we are able to change the price of our advertising budget to get more out of our advertising by paying a higher price or lowering our advertising this is a variable cost.</li>

          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The product marketed by The Backstage is a website in which theatre lovers can share reviews of plays they have watched of read, and where they can also find out about upcoming plays in The Netherlands. The website aims to create a sense of community in an industry that is often overlooked and forgotten. We believe that that there are a lot of people out there with a passion for theatre whose interests are not being well considered. And these people would love to connect and learn from each other. With ‘The Backstage’ they would be able to share their opinions with honesty, knowing they will find a safe and open-minded web on the other side. By people feeling taken care of and supported, we will make their theatre experience more enjoyable. We want to focus on a target group of older people (50 to 65) that maybe have enjoyed theatre their whole lives but as years went by lost connections within the industry. People that would like to reach for others with interests alike to theirs but do not really know how to do so. The Backstage will be an easy-to-use website that also aims to modernize theatre. This is why we are opting for a fresh look in the visual identity of the website. An aesthetic that portrays that passion for theatre can be modern and on-trend. That way, other generations can also feel a part of the digital world, as they discover how they can enjoy their passions online.

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>


          <p>The evolution from the first to the second lean canvas for "The Backstage" platform showcases a notable change in its target audience, features, and strategies. Originally our team thought that the best target audience would be between 18 to 25-year-olds, but once we started looking for people to interview and ask them about their theatre preferences or interests. We notice that most answers or information would come from individuals aged 50 to 65, indicating a deeper understanding of market needs and where should we put our focus on. After doing some research and based on these same problems interviews our team decided to also switch the original website's features from ticketing convenience to include reviews, community engagement, and curated recommendations, addressing broader challenges faced by theater enthusiasts, most of them felt like there was lacking a theatre community and a safe specific space where you could share your thoughts and know more about what others think. Additionally, we kept instagram because we notice it was also very famous between this new audience, however most people also mentioned Facebook (a social media that Gen Z does not't really use). Revenue streams now include collaborations with student organizations and crowdfunding campaigns. This transition underscores the platform's adaptability and responsiveness to market feedback, positioning it for increased relevance and impact in the theater community.</p>
          <p>The transition from the second to the third lean canvas for "The Backstage" platform marks a significant evolution driven by a combination of market insights and operational challenges. While the second lean canvas identified a shift in target demographic towards older theater enthusiasts aged 50 to 65, the third canvas deepens more in the team trying to understand the website's future features and user-friendly design catered specifically to this new target audience. We made a prototype and presented to some people (mostly inside our target audience)so we could obtain more insights and recommendations in how could we build a great website for them. When it comes to our channels, an unexpected obstacle emerged during the development phase, as the team encountered difficulties in establishing a business account on Facebook (a channel initially identified for reaching this new target audience). Consequently, the decision was made to pivot away from Facebook and focus mainly on Instagram, since it has a equally popularity within our audience. As a team we also agreed that focusing in one social media could be more efficient and aadvantageous, because we could mainly focus on instgarm and put all our effort on it. Additionally, recognizing the importance of direct communication with potential users, (and knowing that most people has an email) the team integrated email marketing into their strategy, utilizing platforms like Mailchimp to distribute newsletters and engage with subscribers. This shift in channel strategy, along with the refinement of platform features, underscores "The Backstage's" adaptability and commitment to customer-centricity, positioning itself for sustainable growth and success in the theater community.</p>
          <p>In summary, the progression from the initial to the final lean canvas for "The Backstage" platform marks a meaningful evolution driven by a clear understanding based on our research and interviews and what would work best for our website and target audience. While the shift from targeting young adults to older theater enthusiasts aged 50 to 65 in the second canvas marked a critical adjustment, the subsequent transition to the third canvas deepened this understanding, emphasizing tailored features and user-friendly designs for our new demographic. Despite coming across unexpected struggles, such as challenges with establishing a business account on Facebook, the team demonstrated flexibility by pivoting towards Instagram and integrating email marketing to foster direct communication with users. Through these strategic adaptations and the continued refinement of website features, "The Backstage" underscores its commitment to customer-centricity and readiness for sustained growth and impact within the theater community.</p>
