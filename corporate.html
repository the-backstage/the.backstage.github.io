         <ol> <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> Problem/context: </strong> In this digital Era people's connections are becoming superficial and shallow </p>

         <P class="texthomepage"> <strong> Statement/belief: </strong> It is necessary to drift away from an excessive self-focus and open our minds and hearts to others </P>

         <P class="texthomepage"> <strong> Desired Outcome: </strong> Only then we can revive the sense of community and togetherness and build a world of real connections  </P>

         <P class="texthomepage"> “In a world where life gets busy, and connections become brief and shallow. We believe that only if we manage to look outside of ourselves to others. Only then we can build a caring world of real connections, where we can truly reveal ourselves backstage." </p> </ol>

    <p>

      <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> Bio:</strong> Evelyn works as a librarian for most of her career, fostering a love of literature and learning in her community. In her free time, she attends book club meetings and explores cultural events like theatre performances. Evelyn has noticed a decline in the quality of theatre productions in recent years, which has decreased her enthusiasm for attending shows. However, she remains hopeful that she will discover new and captivating performances to enjoy. She values her friendships and often attends cultural events with friends who share her interests. Despite her frustrations, Evelyn remains open-minded and continues to seek out new experiences and opportunities for intellectual stimulation. 
    </p>

     <p class="texthomepage">  <strong> Social Media Usage:</strong> Evelyn uses Instagram to stay in touch with friends and family, share updates, and engage in literary discussions. While she appreciates its convenience, she prioritizes face-to-face interactions and finds excessive social media time draining.  </p> 

 
     <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> Motivations: </strong> Exploring cultural activities, staying connected with friends and family, lifelong learning. Now that her kids have grown and left home, Evelyn and her husband find themself with new free time that they would like to spend in cultural and enriching activities they enjoy. </p>

 
     <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> Goals:</strong> Engaging in leisure activities, attending cultural events, such as ballet, shows and concerts, but also expanding her knowledge. </p>

 

     <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> Frustrations: </strong> Feeling that theatre productions are becoming less appealing over time, challenges with crowded theatre, limited availability of high-quality performances </p>

        <h4>
          <p class="fw-bolder texthomepage">Brand Name</p> </h4>
            <ol>
          <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> Why The Backstage?: </strong> We chose “The Backstage” for our Brand’s name, because in theatres even if the show is on the stage there is a lot of hard work going on in the backstage that the audience does not get to experience. Therefore, we want to bring the backstage to the audience, where people can embrace our brand with an open mind and honesty, being left with the feeling that they are being cared for in a supportive environment. This way, we are able to expand the theatre experience, without secrets, just authenticity. </p> </ol>
          
          <h4>
            <p class="fw-bolder">Visual Identity</p> </h4>
              <ol>
                <p class="texthomepage">We understand our persona's frustrations with the declining quality of theatre productions and the challenges of crowded venues. That's why our visual identity is designed to create a welcoming and immersive atmosphere, encouraging her and other theatre lovers to rediscover the joy of attending cultural events. Through our brand's commitment to authenticity and refinement, we aim to provide them with memorable experiences that align with their motivations for exploration and lifelong learning. </p>
            <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> The colours: </strong>Our visual identity, characterized by the calming tons of blue, purple, and the vibrant energy of green, is carefully made to align with our brand values and vision. Blue conveys a sense of trust and honesty, aligning perfectly with our commitment to integrity and sincerity. Purple symbolizes openness and creativity, reflecting our value of open-mindedness and our belief in the power of diverse perspectives within the theatrical community. Green represents growth, renewal, and care, embodying our dedication to raise connections and supporting one another in a world where authentic relationships are increasingly rare.</p> 
            <p class="texthomepage"> <strong> The fonts: </strong>Furthermore, the chosen fonts—The Seasons, Bely Display, Bennet Banner, and DM Sans Light 300—enhance the sophistication and elegance of our brand, reinforcing the idea of revealing oneself "backstage" in a context that is both authentic and refined. By combining these elements, our visual identity creates a cohesive and immersive experience for our target audience of theatre lovers. It invites them to not only engage with the performances on stage but also to connect with each other and with themselves on a deeper level, in line with our brand vision of fostering a caring world of genuine connections. In essence, our visual identity serves as a visual manifestation of our brand values and vision, providing a compelling and resonant platform for meaningful engagement within the theatrical community.</p></ol>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>This marketing campaign has the purpose to raise awareness and establish solid relationships within a brand and its potential users. The brand in question is our ‘The Backstage’, where we aim to be put out our product (website) in the market by Friday 5th of April. We tried to engage our target audience by sharing interesting content both on mail and social media. It was important for us that our content portrays the values and intentions of the project. In order to accomplish the goal, we previously had to come across a crystal-clear definition of our value proposition. We defined The Backstage as ‘a brand that intends to connect theatre lovers in an honest way; through care and support, it aims to create a safe and modern space in which users can express themselves and learn from each other open-mindedly'. A message that includes our four essential values: care, support, honesty and open mindedness.</p>
          <p>The promotional activities we executed were taken to term on two media channels. We used e-mail and Instagram to make our brand (and its consequent message) come across. Despite having both fronts open, we took the decision of dedicating extra effort and time in the latest channel (Instagram) since this was our main mean of communication. We chose Instagram because it is a simple and dynamic platform, very useful to spread our word. Anyone can see what is published in a public profile on this social media, which means your content can pop up in anyone's for your page. Therefore, it seems easier dragging new people and reaching a greater number of viewers. Furthermore, Instagram is vastly known and very popular, so it just made sense to use it. But also, Instagram is very visual and fast, creating brief impressions on people which are crucial to build our brand awareness</p>  
          <p>Types of posts we made:  
              <li>Event announcements (website launch, newsletter launch) - With these posts we wanted to keep the audience informed of what we just dropped or what we had yet to come. Brand objective of raising awareness about ‘The Backstage’</li> 
              <li>Brand Insights - the purpose of this posts is for the audience to feel closer to our brand. They get to know what we are all about. We stablish strong relationships with them by sharing our intentions.</li>   
              <li>Behind the scenes – these types of posts show transparency and authenticity we do not want our audience that we are hiding anything from them</li>
              <li>Promotional video – raise awareness and reach more people (meet our other objective of gaining followers). Make them feel attached to the company and start building a relationship</li>
              <li>Survey/polls, questions - with these posts we intended to make our profile dynamic and interactive.</li> 
              <li>Memes, fun facts, industry news - aimed to catch people’s attention, make them have fun and be invested in our page.</li>
              <li>Good morning and good night posts, thank you posts, greetings- to keep the audience engaged and transmit the values of caring and support that our brand stands for</li> 
              On top of that, we also used Chimp mail to create and distribute our newsletter. We decided to publish a new article on our newsletter every Sunday and keep our audience informed about it with our Instagram posts (we added the link to the newsletter in our Instagram bio too). 
              We decided to create a newsletter to make our audience feel closer to us, curious, attached and consequently become loyal supporters of our brand. All in all, the intention of the newsletter was to create a subscriber base and stablish strong long-term relationships with them. </p>


          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Target Audience</h4>
          <p>The audience chosen was adults within 50 and 65 years old. As we did our first interviews and dived deep into the Theatre Lovers we wanted to target. We decided on this age group due to the Google forms we created because most results were between the ages 45 to 54. However, in the in-person interviews, we found older people (between 55 and 77) who were interested in the theatre. With that said we decided to make our target group around the age gap (50 to 65), so it would be extremely broad. The generation targeted is more present on Facebook. However, several business and brand profiles are being put down and banned on Facebook, so our main social media platform during the campaign will be Instagram, due to being equally valid option for meeting our purpose.</p>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Effect</h4>
          <p>We want our target audience to feel a sense of community, where than can easily connect with other and freely share their passions and opinions about theatre and well-informed. We aim to guarantee that the before and after theatre experience is more enjoyable and easier. Moreover, we want to build trust, meaning in the target audience’s eyes we are a trustworthy brand.  </p>

            <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Response</h4>
          <p>In response we expect our target audience to engage with the website, once it is launched by leaving reviews, comments, starting conversations with each other, buying tickets and naturally mouth-to-mouth marketing </p>

          </p>


          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <p>
            <li><strong>Instagram:</strong> Gen Z is drawn to aesthetically pleasing content, making Instagram's platform ideal for posting stunning photos and behind-the-scenes glimpses of stage productions. Gen Z values interaction and engagement with brands. Instagram's interactive features like polls and question stickers provide opportunities for direct engagement, allowing the brand to gather feedback and insights from Gen Z theater enthusiasts. We will also take advantage of theater-related hashtags on Instagram, that will give our brand a tap into Gen Z's interest in current trends and increase visibility.</li>
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <p>

            <li> Before having any social media we used customer acquisition rate as one of our key metrics. We manage to reach about 15 people through word-of-mouth and direct interactions with our family and friends.  </li>
            <li> Another initial key metric used by our team was the customer feedback score: We asked feedback from family and friends. We told them about our idea and value proposition and they gave us valuable insights such as if our value proposition actually resonated with the target audience we wanted to reach. It also helped us identify areas of strength and improvement according to our future website. </li>
      </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To help our brand in the beginning each one of the founders will invest around 100€ per 6 months (approximately 800€ in total investment)  </li>
            <li>Create a Free-Trial Model, which offers a free basic version of your product or service with limited features, while charging for premium upgrades, additional features, or enhanced functionality, appealing to both free users and paying customers. Since we have a new website that is not very well known the premium version would be 36€ per year (3€ monthly subscription). Aiming to achieve around at least 100 subscriptions, that would have a total of 360€ of revenue</li>
            <li> So, the overall revenue streams in the first year of developing our website would be 1160€</li> 
          </ul>

        </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>

            <li>For website development of our brand our team decided to not do an outside hire to execute this task so we could save on costs. Our team (the 4 founders of this brand) are the ones responsible for the development of the website. As well as content creation for the website, we would also be responsible for the writing, designs and photos on our website. Therefore, website developers and content creation hires will not be part of the fixed costs.  </li> 

          <br>
          <p>Fixed Costs

            <li>For the domain registration for “TheBackstage.site” we are going to subscribe to an annual subscription in “Domain.com” (see appendix) of 1,85€ and we also decided to include in the subscription a domain privacy and protection fee of 8,36€ (also per year). This leaves us with a total of a fixed annual cost for the website domain of 10,21€.</li>
            <li> We need to have a hosting server for our website, according to Forbes, a small simple subscription plan is the best for small/new websites. Therefore we will be taking the basic subscription plan with WordPress and Bluehost which is 1,85€ per month due to a current 75% discount they have. This would costs us 22,20€ for the first year. This plan also offers SSL Certificate which keeps personal information, e-commerce transactions and other sensitive data safeguarded with encrypted connections. </li>
          </p>

    			<p> Variable Costs
    				<li> We have to pay for the marketing of our website on social media platforms: We are using Instagram for our marketing and when advertising your brand on Instagram you can choose your own budget which you can change whenever you want. As we are just starting up, we will set our advertising budget to €10 a month to start with which will be an estimate of €120 in the first year. As we are able to change the price of our advertising budget to get more out of our advertising by paying a higher price or lowering our advertising this is a variable cost. </li> 
          </p>
          <br>
          <li> So, the overall costs in the first year of developing our website will be €152,41</li>

The website aims to create a sense of community in an industry that is often overlooked and forgotten. We believe that that there are a lot of people out there with a passion for theatre whose interests are not being well considered. And these people would love to connect and learn from each other. With ‘The Backstage’ they would be able to share their opinions with honesty, knowing they will find a safe and open-minded web on the other side. By people feeling taken care of and supported, we will make their theatre experience more enjoyable. We want to focus on a target group of older people (50 to 65) that maybe have enjoyed theatre their whole lives but as years went by lost connections within the industry. People that would like to reach for others with interests alike to theirs but do not really know how to do so. The Backstage will be an easy-to-use website that also aims to modernize theatre. This is why we are opting for a fresh look in the visual identity of the website. An aesthetic that portrays that passion for theatre can be modern and on-trend. That way, other generations can also feel a part of the digital world, as they discover how they can enjoy their passions online.</li>

          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <p>

            <li><strong>Instagram:</strong>The target audience aimed to be reached is between 50 and 65. We use Instagram to approach them, since most of the people among these ages use this platform instead of others like TikTok. We tried to create a page for our brand in Facebook since it is also one of the most famous social medias between our target audience, however it is difficult right now to create a page on the social media because they are getting banned. Instead, we made the decision to create an account on Instagram. In this platform we post daily photos and videos. And stories with fun facts or surveys. We started creating reels and posting memes since this is what seems to get more viral in the app. We have also started to use hashtags to try and reach a broader audience. We keep our profile updated and we are careful that it matches our visual identity. We use bright colours (green and purple) that intend to give the theatre a fresh and modern look.  </li>
            <li><strong>MailChimp</strong> We use MailChimp to distribute our newsletter. Every Sunday we share a new entrance. To the people subscribed to it we send them an email. We also added the link to it on our Instagram profile. We usually post a couple of post a week as a reminder and when we upload the new entrance we inform about it on Instagram. MailChimp enable us to create a good newsletter, the design in aesthetically pleasing and resonates with the visual identity we chose for The Backstage. It also lets us distribute the product easily as it shares the emails with all the members subscribed. </li>
          </p>
        

          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <p>

            <li> We created a google forms and send it to our family and friends (who also spread it around); We got 115 answers, where 52,2% of the people who answered where between the ages of 45 to 54, 53% identify as female and 84% live outside of the the netherlands.</li>

            <li> When it comes to likes and views. Our instagram videos have between 50 to 100 views and overall our posts have between 4 to 10 likes. </li>
      </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To help our brand in the beginning each one of the founders will invest around 100€ per 6 months (approximately 800€ in total investment)  </li>
            <li> Our team will collaborate with theater-related student organizations on campus and from other colleges in the Netherlands to possible co-host events. Potentially attracting funding from student activity budgets or sponsorship from campus organizations. We expect them to cover over 1000€</li>
            <li>We also intent do get sponsorchips from theatre organizations, B2B situation where they invest in our brand and we will advertise them in our website and our links to buy tickets will take people to their website for ticket purchasing, we want to ask for at leat 7000€ for the first full year.</li>

            <li>So in total for the first year of revenues streams we are aiming for 8300€</li>
        </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>

          <li>For website development of our brand our team decided to not do an outside hire to execute this task so we could save on costs. Our team (the 4 founders of this brand) are the ones responsible for the development of the website. As well as content creation for the website, we would also be responsible for the writing, designs and photos on our website. Therefore, website developers and content creation hires will not be part of the fixed costs.  </li>
          <br>
          <p>Fixed Costs:
            <li>For the domain registration for “TheBackstage.site” we are going to subscribe to an annual subscription in “Domain.com” (see appendix) of 1,85€ and we also decided to include in the subscription a domain privacy and protection fee of 8,36€ (also per year). This leaves us with a total of a fixed annual cost for the website domain of 10,21€.</li>
            <li> We need to have a hosting server for our website, according to Forbes, a small simple subscription plan is the best for small/new websites. Therefore we will be taking the basic subscription plan with WordPress and Bluehost which is 1,85€ per month due to a current 75% discount they have. This would costs us 22,20€ for the first year. This plan also offers SSL Certificate which keeps personal information, e-commerce transactions and other sensitive data safeguarded with encrypted connections. </li> 
            <li>We are going to use Email Marketing to send out weekly newsletters through an email marketing company: "Mailchimp" which costs us €18,61 a month. This will be €223,32 the first year.</li>
            <li>We have to pay for the marketing of our website on social media platforms: We are using Instagram for our marketing and when advertising your brand on Instagram you can choose your own budget which you can change whenever you want. As we are just starting up, we will set our advertising budget to €60 a month to start with which will be an estimate of €700 in the first year. As we are able to change the price of our advertising budget to get more out of our advertising by paying a higher price or lowering our advertising this is a variable cost.</li>

			      
          </p>
         <p> Variable costs
	         <li>We have to pay for the marketing of our website on social media platforms: We are using Instagram. For our marketing and when advertising your brand on Instagram you can choose your own budget which you can change whenever you want. As we are just starting up, we will set our advertising budget to €500 a month to start with which will be an estimate of 6000€ in the first year. As we are able to change the price of our advertising budget to get more out of our advertising by paying a higher price or lowering our advertising. The total of social media marketing cost is 6000€</li>  
          <br>
          <li>So, the overall costs in the first year of developing our website will be of approximately 6256€</li> 
        </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The product marketed by The Backstage is a website in which theatre lovers can share reviews of plays they have watched of read, and where they can also find out about upcoming plays in The Netherlands. The website aims to create a sense of community in an industry that is often overlooked and forgotten. We believe that that there are a lot of people out there with a passion for theatre whose interests are not being well considered. And these people would love to connect and learn from each other. With ‘The Backstage’ they would be able to share their opinions with honesty, knowing they will find a safe and open-minded web on the other side. By people feeling taken care of and supported, we will make their theatre experience more enjoyable. We want to focus on a target group of older people (50 to 65) that maybe have enjoyed theatre their whole lives but as years went by lost connections within the industry. People that would like to reach for others with interests alike to theirs but do not really know how to do so. The Backstage will be an easy-to-use website that also aims to modernize theatre. This is why we are opting for a fresh look in the visual identity of the website. An aesthetic that portrays that passion for theatre can be modern and on-trend. That way, other generations can also feel a part of the digital world, as they discover how they can enjoy their passions online.

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>


          <p>The evolution from the first to the second lean canvas for "The Backstage" platform showcases a notable change in its target audience, features, and strategies. Originally our team thought that the best target audience would be between 18 to 25-year-olds, but once we started looking for people to interview and ask them about their theatre preferences or interests. We notice that most answers or information would come from individuals aged 50 to 65, indicating a deeper understanding of market needs and where should we put our focus on. After doing some research and based on these same problems interviews our team decided to also switch the original website's features from ticketing convenience to include reviews, community engagement, and curated recommendations, addressing broader challenges faced by theater enthusiasts, most of them felt like there was lacking a theatre community and a safe specific space where you could share your thoughts and know more about what others think. Additionally, we kept instagram because we notice it was also very famous between this new audience, however most people also mentioned Facebook (a social media that Gen Z does not't really use). Revenue streams now include collaborations with student organizations and crowdfunding campaigns. This transition underscores the platform's adaptability and responsiveness to market feedback, positioning it for increased relevance and impact in the theater community.</p>
          <p>The transition from the second to the third lean canvas for "The Backstage" platform marks a significant evolution driven by a combination of market insights and operational challenges. While the second lean canvas identified a shift in target demographic towards older theater enthusiasts aged 50 to 65, the third canvas deepens more in the team trying to understand the website's future features and user-friendly design catered specifically to this new target audience. We made a prototype and presented to some people (mostly inside our target audience)so we could obtain more insights and recommendations in how could we build a great website for them. When it comes to our channels, an unexpected obstacle emerged during the development phase, as the team encountered difficulties in establishing a business account on Facebook (a channel initially identified for reaching this new target audience). Consequently, the decision was made to pivot away from Facebook and focus mainly on Instagram, since it has a equally popularity within our audience. As a team we also agreed that focusing in one social media could be more efficient and aadvantageous, because we could mainly focus on instgarm and put all our effort on it. Additionally, recognizing the importance of direct communication with potential users, (and knowing that most people has an email) the team integrated email marketing into their strategy, utilizing platforms like Mailchimp to distribute newsletters and engage with subscribers. This shift in channel strategy, along with the refinement of platform features, underscores "The Backstage's" adaptability and commitment to customer-centricity, positioning itself for sustainable growth and success in the theater community.</p>
          <p>In summary, the progression from the initial to the final lean canvas for "The Backstage" platform marks a meaningful evolution driven by a clear understanding based on our research and interviews and what would work best for our website and target audience. While the shift from targeting young adults to older theater enthusiasts aged 50 to 65 in the second canvas marked a critical adjustment, the subsequent transition to the third canvas deepened this understanding, emphasizing tailored features and user-friendly designs for our new demographic. Despite coming across unexpected struggles, such as challenges with establishing a business account on Facebook, the team demonstrated flexibility by pivoting towards Instagram and integrating email marketing to foster direct communication with users. Through these strategic adaptations and the continued refinement of website features, "The Backstage" underscores its commitment to customer-centricity and readiness for sustained growth and impact within the theater community.</p>
